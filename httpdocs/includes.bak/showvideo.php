This was Rohith's second century of the 2011 season, and  fifth century in his CCL career. He was dismissed rather freakishly by a direct throw from Andrew Dunbar in his bowling follow-through. Rohith then captured 3 FCCC wickets. Cricket is such a great leveler that even this great all round performance could not win him this game. He more than made up for this setback by continuing to score heavily with 465 runs in the season, thus topping the CCCC batting charts and leading the team to the premier league championship.", "videos/H 6-4-11 Rohith Ramkumar.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIhBRttUHtQ"),
    array("Hamayun Zaheer", "June 11, 2011: CSCC captain Hamayun Zaheer led from the front with his excellent spell capturing 4 FCCC wickets (8-0-34-4) and then producing a much needed cameo in the middle by scoring 31 runs in 32 balls with 3 fours, thus helping CSCC  win this hard-fought game. Hamayun led and motivated his team both as captain and player with his ideas and contribution. He was then deservedly named the Player of the Match to cap it all.", "videos/H 6-11-11 Hamayun Zaheer.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlyHMqRqATc"),
    array("Kit Diasabeygunawardena", "June 11, 2011: During the first game on the new mat with uneven bounce at the Memorial Park, Kit Diasabeygunawardena from FCCC walked into bat with 5 wickets down for just 45 runs and the CSCC bowlers on fire. What Kit then produced was a spectacular counter assault in his inimitable fashion - swinging his bat on almost every ball and connecting cleanly with amazing regularity. He hit the CSCC bowlers all over the park at will, collecting 57 runs in just 30 balls with 1 four and 6 towering sixes. This gem of an innings enabled FCCC set a competitive total to defend that looked impossible when he walked in to bat.","videos/H 6-11-11 Kit Diasabeygunawardena.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNzGahnAMU"),

Coming in at 8 down with 75 runs to win, he injected the much-needed urgency in the CCB chase of an imposing FCCC total with quick ones and twos. He then suddenly savaged a delivery from Dipal Patel and sent it screaming over the long-on boundary for a breathtaking six. That shot announced his ambition. He was gunning for a victory. And in Aditya Kasukurt's able company, he achieved a memorable heist for CCB in its very first season. Both shared the Player of the Match award. Rajesh scored 45 unbeaten runs off 48 balls with 2 boundaries and that six.","videos/H 8-28-10 Rajesh Rathod.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOmmpnxtYXE"),
    array("Sriram Akella", "August 7, 2010: The day FRCC came of age with their first victory against FCCC in more than 10 years, thanks to a splendid allround performance from their rookie, Sriram Akella. First, Sriram foxed a well-settled Ravi Sajjan right in front of the stumps with a well adjusted quicker delivery and got the on-rampage Kit to mistime a big shot (4-0-19-2). Then he guided the FRCC chase by displaying exemplary composure while playing a sheet anchor role when wickets were falling around him. Though he was dropped three times, he made sure that every life counted and capitalized on it. The true worth of his 25 runs off 65 balls with one huge six was more in the confidence he gave his teammates that this game could be won. Sreeram was deservedly declared (maiden) Player of the Match for his contributions both with the leather and timber.", "videos/H 8-7-10 Sriram Akella.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3RkQv1knOE"),

Put into bat after FCCC won the toss, RBCC lost early wickets with both experienced openers back in the pavilion. Suvendu then played a lone hand with solid defense mixed with 2 boundaries and 2 sixes. His effort enabled RBCC to go past the 100 run mark which proved to be a fighting total under the bowler-friendly conditions.", "videos/H 4-30-11 Suvendu Samal.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeUAgVtRdK0"),

When FCCC batted first, Bhodhayan struck first blood with a beauty of a delivery taking out Ravi's middle stump. Omar then joined and the first ball he saw found his outside edge straight to the keeper. Toward the end when LCC were giving up extra runs, Bhodhayan was brought back into the attack and cleaned up the rest of the FCCC lineup in the 26th over with just 71 runs on the board. This effectively sealed the game in LCC's favor.","videos/H 6-19-10 Bodhayan Chakravarthy.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikkQ_moHd00"),  
    array("Amit Gandhi", "June 5, 2010: A memorable upset looked on the cards when Amit Gandhi seized the opportunity and tore into the FCCC bowling attack while chasing a modest target of 142 runs. Rest of the BCC batsmen failed to support him though, so they fell 37 runs short. Amit's innings of 43 runs in 80 balls was a fine mix of solid defence and stylish hits, one of them being a towering six.","videos/H 6-5-10 Amit Gandhi.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSSrP25RqKU"),
    array("Ganesh Sharma", "June 25, 2005: Ganesh Sharma won the Player of the Match award for a champion batting performance for FCCC against the arch-rivals CCCC-Gold. Ganesh anchored the 150-run chase with a great exhibition of technically correct yet aggressive batting when he scored 71 runs from 88 balls with 7 4's and 2 6's. Nice balance, bent knees, elbow position, bat follow-through, eyes watching the ball all the way during each of these strokes. It was a treat to watch.", "videos/H 6-25-05 Ganesh Sharma.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LaOGxd964E"),
    array("Jarrar Jaffari", "June 25, 2005: One of the most exciting chapters in the FCCC-Gold rivalry, thanks to a spectacular bowling effort from Jarrar Jaffari at the end that single handedly rocked the FCCC march to an easy victory. No FCCC-Gold game could end without a twist in the plot and what a twist this one had. With FCCC needing just 7 runs to win and 6 wickets in hand, Jarrar was brought back in his second spell. He produced a fiery spell to capture 5 wickets in 3 overs without any run. Alas, he could not get the last man standing. It was an unforgettable spell, neverthless.", "videos/H 6-25-05 Jarrar Jaffari.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGxUf4RNwAk"),

Kervyn combined with Vikas Chugh (38) for a super-quick opening partnership of 128 runs in the first 14 overs while chasing a huge target of 252 against FCCC. He was picked the POTW for a job well done by bringing victory to CSCC and finishing up the CSCC's Premier League season on a high note, and acheiving 1000+ runs in a season.","videos/H 9-27-08 Kervyn Dimney.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVtLkNJX-xY"),  
    array("Aditya Kasukurt", "Aug 28, 2010: A classic act of deception from Aditya Kasukurt. His obdurate defence was designed to lull FCCC into a false sense of security while 8 CCB wickets tumbled with 75 runs to go. Then he suddenly switched gears, gunning for an improbable victory. And in Rajesh Rathod's able company, he achieved a memorable heist for CCB in its very first season. Both shared the Player of the Match award. Aditya scored 38 unbeaten runs off 84 balls with 3 boundaries and one six.","videos/H 8-28-10 Aditya Kasukurt.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm_W1_Il37g"),
    array("Aditya Kaundinya", "June 2, 2007: Aditya Kaundinya from CSU won both the Player of the Match and Player of the Week awards for a stupendous performance in a losing cause against FCCC. Aditya batted with so much serenity under pressure for his 79 runs in 127 balls with 8 boundaries, but he was left with too much to do on his own as his team-mates succumbed rather meekly to post a modest total of 162. Aditya then switched on his legspin with devastating effect, capturing 4 wickets for 44 runs to slow down the FCCC victory march.", "videos/H 6-2-07 Aditya Kaundinya.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xquNyQ6VDbs"),
    array("Noman Khan", "June 6, 2009: Noman Khan was the key to RBCC's Premier League Championship in 2009. He asserted his impact at the beginning of the season itself with an all round performance against FCCC that won him the Player of the Match award. Batting first, the highlight of the RBCC innings was Noman who showed tremendous patience and scripted the RBCC middle innings story. Noman was run out after contributing 34 valuable runs in 60 balls with 1 boundary and 1 six.  Defending a modest total of 164 against a good FCCC batting line-up, Noman bowled fast and furious for his 2 wicket haul in 8 overs, giving away just 18 runs.", "videos/H 6-6-09 Noman Khan.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT6pozobhQE"),
    array("Rupesh Sagar Muthyala", "June 7, 2008: A Rupesh Sagar Muthyala gem in a losing cause. Those were some rare occasions when an opposition batsman would tear into the multi-pronged FCCC bowling attack in its pomp days and this certainly was one from the top drawer. Rupesh flayed the bowlers to all parts of the ground for a fantastic century of 117 runs in only 84 balls that amazingly contained 9 hits to the boundary and 7 over them. He was not done yet. He also bowled an economical spell of 8-0-33-2. LCC lost the game, but Rupesh won the Player of the Match award hands-down for his superlative performance.","videos/H 6-7-08 Rupesh Sagar Muthyala.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwwL9qoE6rI"),

    array("Akhil Pai", "May 17, 2010: Akhil Pai won the Player of the Match and Featured Player of the Week awards for his superb century against FCCC and helped CSCC win the game convincingly. He paced his innings to perfection. Overcame a little hesitant start and flourished extremely well thereafter. His 106 runs in 103 balls contained 9 boundaries, reaching the well-deserved century in the penultimate over. Unfortunately, his century shot is not caught on tape :-(", "videos/H 5-17-09 Akhil Pai.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyaLvFu5gng"),
    array("Arun Tholudur", "May 21, 2011: Arun Tholudur from CCCC scored his maiden century in CCL in an innings studded with some dismissive strokes mixed with some deft touches; it was sensible savagery at its best. Under overcast/rainy conditions, against a balanced FCCC bowling attack, Arun took complete charge of the proceedings by scoring 100 runs in 111 balls, hitting 5 fours and 9 sixes, and took the game away from the opposition. No wonder he was declared the Player of the Match as well as the Player of the Week.", "videos/H 5-21-11 Arun Tholudur.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ0VD1FtbIo"),
    array("Dipal Patel", "May 15, 2010: The day when RBCC had the misfortune of running into Dipal Patel at his bowling best. Within his first four overs, RBCC were reduced to 23 for 6 wickets, five of which were claimed by Dipal for a measly 9 runs. This class act from Dipal did not involve express pace but had plenty of movement both ways, and variation in line and length. FCCC won the game with a handsome margin of 70 runs, thanks to Dipal's superb bowling spell that won him the Player of the Match award.","videos/H 5-15-10 Dipal Patel.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55KMGx9bcjY"),

He produced a tight spell of  6-1-10-3 to smother the paper-strong FCCC batting order, and then started the chase in the earnest with 5 runs in 15 balls.","videos/H 8-28-10 Aashish Dalmiya.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtvheDFRfoU"),
    array("Abhishek Chandrasekaran", "August 7, 2010: Abhishek Chandrasekaran came up with a fine allround performance on the day FRCC came of age with their first victory against FCCC in more than 10 years. First, Abhishek produced a handy spell of medium pacers, probing the offside line consistently, so getting rewarded with the figures of 6.4-1-22-2. Then he opened the FRCC chase and put it on the right path with a composed innings  of 20 runs in 33 balls that contained an amazingly effortless six.", "videos/H 8-7-10 Abhishek Chandrasekaran.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TndXbqw8C2E"),

Before that, Altaf remained unbeaten and scored very useful 9 runs from 12 balls to get RBCC to a fighting total. Then, in his 2nd over, Altaf made a major dent to FCCC's cause when he took a hat-trick (Phani 'caught', Gopal 'LBW', Rajesh 'bowled'). His final figures read 3-1-33-4 and it was apt that he took the last FCCC wicket to seal the victory.", "videos/H 10-2-10 Altaf Ahmad.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRvRpW4T758"),

Coming in at the fall of an early first wicket, Dharam top scored with 33 runs not out from 40 balls with 4 boundaries and took LCC home. The highlight was an over of leg spin that Dharam hammered for 2 imperious pulled boundaries.","videos/H 6-19-10 Dharam Patel.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoQsekeccEk"),
    array("Abhay Natu", "Oct 8, 2005: Abhay Natu, together with Shashi Chikkanna, performed probably the greatest Houdini act in the recent CCL history. In the knockouts championship final, FCCC closed on the victory with CSCC 9 wickets down and 52 runs to go. That is when Abhay and Shashi stepped up to the plate and delivered the almost impossible. Victory was achieved on the 4th ball of the last over.

It is not hard to establish that Nadeem Rafiqs performance of 7-0-16-8 against Green is the best bowling figures in the history of CCL. Nadeem's dominance on the field that day started earlier when he opened the FCCC batting and whacked 4 towering sixes in the very first over (33 runs, 17 balls, 1 four, 4 sixes). Green players must have rued their decision to appeal for his runout; a decision Nadeem got upset about and then vented all his anger on the hapless Green batting lineup. Their captain remarked that Nadeem's spell was unplayable and all of the balls were genuinely wicket taking missiles. No wonder Nadeem was adjudged Player of the Match and Player of the Week.", "videos/H 8-20-05 Nadeem Rafiq.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0nHMCxkzs"),

He scored an incredible 311 runs in the 3 games of the KO's at a whopping average of 311. It was a great pity that his unbeaten knock of 98 runs after opening the chase in the finals fell 17 runs short of the championship. The innings was full of smart flicks and late-cuts that took full advantage of the fast outfield backside of the wicket.","videos/H 9-25-04 Rajesh Mosur.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nt939GuD9o"),

Chasing an imposing FCCC total of 218 runs, Naveen refused to roll over and play dead; instead came out with all guns blazing. He  shepherded a rollicking opening partnership of 65 runs which came at a brisk scoring rate and then anchored the middle order with run-a-ball half century of 66 runs with 7 boundaries and 2 sixes.

Rohit stitched a 70-run partnership, highest in the game, with Akhil Pai to which he contributed 18 runs. His solid support at one end enabled Akhil to tear into the FCCC attack at the other end and amass 238 runs for CSCC. Rohit then capitalized on the ideal start provided by Mehmood Khan and took out two FCCC middle-order wickets, Dipal Patel and Rajesh Idate, to put the chase beyond FCCC, ending with the analysis of  3-0-16-2.", "videos/H 5-17-09 Rohit Shah.swf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak0EzXvpQyA"),

Vicky ripped apart the bowling and hit five boundaries in his brief stay. When he departed, missing a swinging Nadeem Yorker, he had scored 30 of the 44 runs on board at a strike rate of 120.

After scoring about 30 runs, he started getting cramps and took even more risks to score as much as possible. Akhil was out after scoring a well-made 43 runs in 41 balls.

That is when Kervyn shifted into a subdued mode by his standards. Tight spell from Omer and Gopal built up the pressure. As a result, Kervyn perished trying to force a shot.
